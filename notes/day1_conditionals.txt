2️⃣ Leap Year Checker
🧠 Logic Explanation

A year is a leap year if:

It is divisible by 4, and

(It is not divisible by 100 or it is divisible by 400)

This rule handles exceptions like 1900 (not leap) and 2000 (leap).

Year	÷4	÷100	÷400	Leap?
2020	✅	❌	-	✅
1900	✅	✅	❌	❌
2000	✅	✅	✅	✅

💻 Code

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

if (year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)):
    print("Leap year")
else:
    print("Not a leap year")

🧩 Why it works

*The first part (year % 4 == 0) checks the basic leap year condition.

*The second part (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0) filters out century years that aren’t multiples of 400.

🔹 3️⃣ Largest of Three Numbers
🧠 Logic Explanation

To find the largest among 3 numbers, compare step by step:

If a > b and a > c → a is largest

Else if b > c → b is largest

Else → c is largest

We must use chained conditions.

💻 Code

a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
c = int(input("Enter third number: "))

if a > b and a > c:
    print("Largest number is:", a)
elif b > c:
    print("Largest number is:", b)
else:
    print("Largest number is:", c)

🧩 Why it works

*It compares pairwise in logical order, ensuring exactly one branch prints.

🔹 4️⃣ Grade Calculator
🧠 Logic Explanation

You must:

Get marks of 5 subjects.

Find average = total / 5.

Use if-elif ladder to determine grade.

Average	Grade
≥ 90	A
75–89	B
60–74	C
< 60	Fail

💻 Code

m1 = int(input("Enter mark 1: "))
m2 = int(input("Enter mark 2: "))
m3 = int(input("Enter mark 3: "))
m4 = int(input("Enter mark 4: "))
m5 = int(input("Enter mark 5: "))

avg = (m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 + m5) / 5

if avg >= 90:
    grade = 'A'
elif avg >= 75:
    grade = 'B'
elif avg >= 60:
    grade = 'C'
else:
    grade = 'Fail'

print("Average:", avg)
print("Grade:", grade)

🧩 Why it works

*The first true condition stops the chain, so you don’t need and statements.
*The logic “cascades” in descending order.

🔹 5️⃣ Vowel or Consonant
🧠 Logic Explanation

Take a single alphabet.
If it’s in the set of vowels → print “vowel”, else → “consonant”.

💻 Code

ch = input("Enter a character: ").lower()

if ch in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']:
    print("Vowel")
else:
    print("Consonant")

🧩 Why it works

.lower() ensures case-insensitive comparison.

Using in checks membership efficiently (O(1) average).



Questions for day 1 until conditional flow(if,elif,else, nested if),logical operators(and,not,or) for reasoning ability

1️⃣

You have:

a = 5
b = 10
if a > 2 or b < 5:
    print("Condition True")
else:
    print("Condition False")


Will this print “Condition True” or “Condition False”?
Explain why in one or two sentences.

2️⃣

If you write:

num = 0
if num:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")


What will it print?
Explain how Python treats 0, empty strings, and empty lists in boolean context.

3️⃣

In this code:

x = 20
if x % 4 == 0 and not x % 6 == 0:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")


What condition is being checked here in plain English?

4️⃣

What’s the difference between if a == b: and if a is b:?
Why might a is b be risky when comparing strings or integers?

5️⃣

When would you use nested if instead of elif?
Give a short example (no need for code, just describe the situation).
